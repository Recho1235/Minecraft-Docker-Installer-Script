# Minecraft-Docker-Installer-Script
Script used to install a minecraft server in docker based on itgz minecraft server image. Currently in WIP.

Currently this is working if you were to run on your local machine. I plan to update this to support SSH for easier usage. In the future I may include an argument for usage outside of docker.
